            <p>With a year and a half of professional development experience, I am glad glad to say I have found my passion in life and am excited to continue growing my in my career as a developer.</p>

            <p>Being raised by a small business owner in the cabinet industry I learned of the value of hard work and developed an excelent work ethic from a young age. This work ethic has led me to accomplish great things personally and professionally. While being the staff accountant at my dad's business I was privledged to be tasked with transfering his accounting system from Excel to Quickbooks and create and publish reports for him. In accomplishing this great task I learned the fun of being able to write my own system and processes. At that point I had been a hobbiest developer for a year or so and I decided that it was time to make that my full time job so I took my drive and work ethic and enrolled in a 600+ hour development course and decided to pursue development professionally.</p>
